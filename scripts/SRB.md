Project 1: Copy-Number Variants
========================================================

## Estimating CNV across the genome in a wild opoulation of maize  

- ~20 genomes: WGS.
- In the process of finalizing CNV calls.
- Simulations will inform decisions on appropriate limits and cutt-off values.
- More or less all the code needed is written.
- Tajima's D increases with increasing frequency of CNV.
- Intresting deletion (or inversion) on chr 6 -> investigating now.

- Paper submission targetted for October 2015?

## Comparing the ancient sub-genomes of maize

- Investigate differences in maize1 vs maize2
- early info suggest that maize1 and maize2 are "immune" CNV relative to genes that lack syntenic orthologs in Sorghum.


Project 2: Currently undecided
========================================================
